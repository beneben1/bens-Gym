                        <p>Working out is about more than just showing up to the gym.
                            Knowing where to start, what to do, and what is best for your body and goals are key to your success.
                            But this can be challenging. Many people spend a lot of time in the gym but don't see the results they want.
                            Why? Oftentimes it's because they aren't maximizing their time or focusing on the right exercises. 
                            World Gym offers the best strength training equipment along with an extensive selection of free weights and cardio machines.
                            Knowing which to use and how to use them - and in which order - are key to seeing the results you want.
                            Our fitness trainers will do more than just show you what to do - they'll explain the why behind it.
                            We want to make sure that when you're on your own, you feel fully confident in your workouts and continue to see results.</p>
